# Twitter_clone
Basically a miniaturized clone of twitter

This is a clone of twitter which can be used as a base or template for social websites. Feel free to use it as you like. The backend is solid (the follow and unfollow framework works nicely via js and python, and other features), but the frontend needs a bit more work. Authentication code needs to be reworked to accomodate any custom preferences.
